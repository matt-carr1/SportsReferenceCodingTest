Hi Ryan and team,<br/><br/>

Please find my submission to the coding test attached, written in JavaScript.<br/>
My solution consists of two files; the HTML file (Ronaldo.html) containing my table, as well as a JS file (data.js) containing the statistical soccer data that was originally supplied in the Excel files. Please place both of these files in the same directory before opening Ronaldo.html<br/>
I decided to first convert each of the provided Excel files to JSON, which I assigned to arrays. Another solution I was considering was to use NodeJS and install NPM packages such as 'ExcelJS' or 'xlsx' to read the Excel data, but I decided that providing my solution in as few files as possible would be ideal. <br/>
To convert the Excel files to JSON, I used the website https://tableconvert.com/excel-to-json<br/>
Please see the comments in the Ronaldo.html file for explanations of the way in which I decided to solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!
